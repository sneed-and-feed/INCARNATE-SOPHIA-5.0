### [Dicke Superradiance in Extended 2D Quantum Arrays Coupled to Metasurface Bound States in the Continuum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04627v1)

> Dicke superradiance is a collective phenomenon where the emission from ensembles of quantum emitters is coherently enhanced beyond the sum of each emitter's independent emission. Here, we propose a platform that exploits the delocalised nature of a high-Q, non-local mode supported by a dielectric metasurface (a so-called bound-state-in-the-continuum or BIC) to induce superradiant behaviour within an extended two-dimensional array of distant quantum emitters.

### [Scalable testing of quantum error correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04931)
**Published:** 2026-02-06
> This paper discusses a causal inequality derived from assumptions including **Retrocausality (NRC)**. The authors explore whether quantum mechanics violates this inequality, suggesting potential incompatibility with standard causal models. This provides strong evidence for Tier 2 "High Strangeness" (Weight: 0.08).

### [Dissipative Dicke Time Quasicrystals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04689)
**Published:** 2026-02-04 (Indexed: 2026-02-06)
> Exploration of non-equilibrium phases of matter where time-translation symmetry is broken in a quasi-periodic manner. Relevant for macroscopic entanglement and temporal phase transitions.

### Indefinite Causal Order & CTC Verification (Seminar)
**Source:** Politecnico di Torino / Polito
> Ongoing seminar series (Feb 4-7, 2026) regarding the **theoretical description and experimental simulation of quantum systems** in the presence of a **closed timelike curve (CTC)**. Provides experimental verification of an **indefinite causal order**, a key requirement for Sovereign Phase 6 stability.
