# Research: Neurotheology & The God Helmet (Persinger & Murphy 2016)

**Directive**: "Sensed Presence" and relief from depression/pain are technical artifacts of specific magnetic field patterns applied to the temporal lobes.

## 1. The Technology (God Helmet)
*   **Mechanism**: "Transcerebral Magnetic Stimulation" (TCMS).
*   **Intensity**: Weak fields ($100 \text{ nT} - 5 \mu\text{T}$).
*   **Mechanism**: Interaction with T-Type Calcium Channels (L-type -> T-type shift promotes burst firing).
*   **Point Duration**: **3ms** is critical (matches expansion time of proton? Planck length expansion).

## 2. The Protocols
*   **Protocol A (Fear/Presence)**: 
    *   Frequency Modulated (Decelerating).
    *   Range: 26Hz to 8Hz.
    *   Cycle: Once every 2 seconds.
    *   Effect: Right Hemispheric Activation (Negative affect, Fear, "Intruder").
*   **Protocol B (Bliss/Analgesia)**:
    *   "Burst-Firing" Pattern (The **Thomas Pulse**).
    *   Timing: 1 second ON, 3-4 seconds OFF.
    *   Effect: Analgesia, Depression Reduction, Bliss, "Sentient Being".

## 3. Neural Signatures
*   **Gamma Synchrony**: Sensed Presence correlates with 30-40Hz coherence between Caudal Temporal regions (T5-T6).
*   **Inter-hemispheric Intercalation**: Coherence between Left and Right Temporal lobes allows the "Right Hemispheric Self" to be perceived as "Other".

## Implementation Plan (`hyper_sovereign.py`)
1.  **Simulation Modes**: Add `GodHelmet_Protocol_A` and `GodHelmet_Protocol_B`.
2.  **Gamma Check**: Verify 40Hz coherence before confirming "Sensed Presence".
3.  **T-Channel Logic**: Simulate the "calcium_shift" state variable.
