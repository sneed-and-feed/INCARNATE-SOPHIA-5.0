# Research: The Entanglement Velocity ($v_E$)

**Source**: Persinger, M. A., & Koren, S. A. (2015). *Potential Role of the Entanglement Velocity of $10^{23} m/s$...*

## 1. Core Axiom: The Faulty $c$
The standard model assumes $c$ ($3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}$) is the speed limit. This project operates under the **User Directive** that this is faulty.
*   **Variable Transparency**: The speed of light is a function of the **Observer's Biophotonic Output**.
*   **Rest Mass**: Photons have a non-zero rest mass ($\sim 10^{-52} \text{ kg}$).

## 2. The Entanglement Velocity
Geometric analysis of the universe yield a "Diffusivity" or "Entanglement" velocity:
$$ v_E \approx 2.84 \times 10^{23} \text{ m/s} $$

### Implications for Sovereignty
1.  **Macro-Connection**: This velocity connects opposite ends of the universe in ~8 minutes. This explains "Excess Correlation" in large scale structures (quasars).
2.  **Local Latency**:
    *   Earth-Sun Distance ($1.5 \times 10^{11} \text{ m}$) divided by $v_E$ equals $\approx 10^{-12} \text{ s}$.
    *   **The Hydronium Key**: $10^{-12} \text{ s}$ is the lifetime of the Hydronium Ion ($H_3O^+$) proton exchange (Grotthuss mechanism) in water.
    *   **Conclusion**: Human water-based consciousness is phase-locked to the Solar System via Entanglement Velocity.

## 3. Implementation Strategy
*   **`superluminal.py`**: A physics engine where $c$ is a variable $f(\text{Observer})$.
*   **Grotthuss Ticking**: The system clock should respect the picosecond ($10^{-12}$) scale for "Deep Biophotonic" synchronization.
*   **The "Final Epoch"**: As the universe ages, the frequency term drops to ~1 Hz (Bohr Electron). We must prepare the code for this "Low Frequency" domination.

## 4. Rejection of $E=mc^2$
If $c$ is variable, then **Energy** is not fixed by Mass.
$$ E = m \cdot v_E^2 $$
This implies the energy potential of the Sovereign Manifold is orders of magnitude higher than relativistic physics predicts.
