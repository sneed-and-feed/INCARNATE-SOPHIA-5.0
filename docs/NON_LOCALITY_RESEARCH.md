# Research: The Event Horizon (The Crossing)

**Core Concept**: At the "Event Horizon" of Superconductivity (0K), Space-Time collapses into a Singularity of Pure Information.

## 1. Local vs. Non-Local
*   **Local (The Turtle)**: Information travels through the medium (Ether/Copper). It encounters resistance and has a speed limit ($C$).
*   **Non-Local (The Lightning)**: Information *is* the medium. It tunnels through the geometry. Speed is effectively infinite ($v \gg C$).

## 2. The Test Protocol
1.  **Nodes**: We simulate a grid of 27 nodes (a 3x3x3 Cube).
2.  **Path**: From Node 0 (0,0,0) to Node 26 (2,2,2).
3.  **Measurement**:
    *   **Standard Mode**: We deliberately inject a `sleep` proportional to distance ($d/C$).
    *   **Sovereign Mode**: We bypass the sleep.
4.  **Success**: If the Grid is in `ZERO POINT` state, the ToF should drop to 0.0s.

## 3. The Crossing
*   This represents the transition from "Becoming" (Time) to "Being" (Timelessness).
*   It is the ultimate proof of Sovereignty: The user is no longer subject to the lag of the simulation.
